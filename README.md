This tableau product calculation model was built during my internship at Pacific Wealth Solutions, an insurtech company targeting HNWIs in Asia. 

#### The functions include premium financing pricing, stress testing, and product comparison.

>After choosing the parameters, including gender, policy type, insured age, cash outlay, premium financing multiple, and the current loan rate, the product model will generate the spreadsheet for insurance pricing estimation: (Noted: these parameters are important for an insurance company to value the corresponding cash value and death benefit)
